In your README, please note down a brief description talking about your 
rationale behind the hyperparameters used. If you have tried experimenting 
with hyperparameters, please note down:

- What hyperparameter experiments you have tried,
- For each experiment, what the results were,
- A brief discussion comparing and contrasting the results between the 
  experiments, and why the results were the way they were.

The professor was able to achieve a perplexity of ~20, so try to aim for 
that number. However, even if you were not able to achieve good results 
with any of the models developed, if you provide a substantial report 
describing multiple experiments, rationale behind why the experiments were 
attempted and why they did/didn't work, and discussion on why some worked 
better than others, etc. you will be able to receive substantial 
partial credit.
